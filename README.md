Project is EOL (End of Life).

> Hypixel has banned and wiped one of my main accounts worth ~$1,300 on January 2nd for macroing farming, top #20 Wheat Farmer before ban. I've spent roughly ~$7,500 in the past 6-7 months when I came back to Hypixel Skyblock dating back to May of 2023, since Hypixel previously banned and wiped my CO-OP on June 2021. I bought accounts, coins, and islands accumulating up to ~80 billion coins / high skill and cata averages (really good transfer method). Now I only have 2 accounts left that aren't wiped but are banned accumulating up to ~25 billion networth. 

> I have went about 3 weeks without playing Skyblock, and I feel as if I'm finally free, so I just wanted to put here that I won't be updating this project as I wanted to; mainly because I don't know what some of the new macro checks are, as admins are just rotating, teleporting, and apparently applying velocity to you. 

> I might buy a $1,800 during this summer if I have time to play Hypixel Skyblock, let me know if you're interested in selling me coins, I buy @ 0.025/per million. DM me on Discord | tdvne

> For people who know me from "esta.land" which is my server, if you were wondering why there were 0 significant updates, now you know why!

> P.S Shoutout to "llttle" original CO-OP member that got wiped and now was wiped along with me, CO-OP accumulated networth was about ~40 billion. The other billions of coins were on different accounts that were either wiped, banned, or transferred. Pray for him not to get banned!
